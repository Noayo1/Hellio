Subject: Urgent - Senior DevOps Engineer Needed

Hi Hellio Team,

We need to fill a Senior DevOps Engineer position ASAP. Our infrastructure team is overloaded and we're scaling fast.

Key requirements:
- 5+ years hands-on DevOps experience
- Strong AWS expertise (we're all-in on AWS)
- Kubernetes - production experience is a must, not just theory
- Terraform for IaC - we manage everything as code
- CI/CD pipelines (we use GitLab CI primarily)
- Python or Go for automation scripting

Nice to have:
- Experience with monitoring stacks (we use Prometheus + Grafana)
- AWS certifications (Solutions Architect or DevOps Engineer)
- Experience with microservices architectures
- On-call experience with incident management

The role:
- Leading infrastructure automation initiatives
- Mentoring 2-3 junior engineers
- Architecting our migration to EKS
- On-call rotation (1 week per month)

We're a fast-paced fintech startup, Series B funded. Hybrid work (3 days office in Tel Aviv). Competitive salary + equity.

Timeline: Need to hire within 4 weeks if possible. Can you start sourcing candidates?

Thanks,
Sarah Chen
VP Engineering
