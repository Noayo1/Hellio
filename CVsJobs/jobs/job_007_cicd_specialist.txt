Hello,

Gaming company looking for CI/CD specialist. Our build and deployment pipelines are slow and fragile - taking 45+ minutes per build and failing frequently.

What We Need:
Someone to completely revamp our CI/CD infrastructure and make our deployments fast and reliable.

Responsibilities:
- Redesign Jenkins pipelines (or migrate to better solution)
- Optimize build times (goal: under 10 minutes)
- Implement proper artifact management
- Set up automated testing infrastructure
- Create deployment automation for game servers
- Document everything clearly for the team

Requirements:
- 3-5 years CI/CD pipeline experience
- Expert in Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions
- Experience with build optimization techniques
- Knowledge of artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory)
- Docker and containerization
- Scripting skills (Groovy, Python, Bash)
- Gaming industry experience is bonus but not required

Our Stack:
Unity game engine, Jenkins, Docker, AWS (EC2, S3), Unreal Engine (some projects), Perforce + Git

Challenges You'll Face:
- Large binary files (game assets)
- Multiple platform builds (Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile)
- Complex dependency management
- Distributed build agents

Work Style: We're a gaming company so culture is relaxed but we ship fast.
