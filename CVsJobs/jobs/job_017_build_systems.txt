Subject: Build Systems Engineer - C++ Focus

Hello,

We're a C++ software house building performance-critical systems (trading, networking, embedded). Our build system is ancient and painful. Need someone to modernize it.

The Challenge:
Legacy codebase (15+ years old), custom build scripts, builds taking 2+ hours, fragile dependency management. Developers are frustrated.

What We Need You To Do:
- Modernize C++ build system (CMake migration)
- Implement incremental builds and caching
- Set up distributed build system (distcc, ccache, or similar)
- Create CI pipelines for C++ projects
- Manage third-party dependencies (Conan or vcpkg)
- Optimize compile times
- Set up static analysis (clang-tidy, cppcheck)
- Cross-platform build support (Linux, Windows)

Required Experience:
- 4-6 years in build systems or DevOps
- Strong C++ build systems knowledge (Make, CMake, Bazel)
- Understanding of C++ compilation process
- Experience with build optimization techniques
- CI/CD for compiled languages
- Linux development environment
- Python or Bash scripting

Specific Technical Knowledge:
- CMake advanced features
- Compiler toolchains (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Build caching strategies
- Dependency management for C++
- Docker for build environments
- Static analysis tools
- Package managers (Conan, vcpkg)

Our Stack:
C++17/20, CMake, Jenkins, GitLab, Docker, Linux (Ubuntu/RHEL), Artifactory, GCC/Clang, Python

Nice to Have:
- Bazel experience
- Experience with trading systems or low-latency software
- Knowledge of cross-compilation
- Sanitizers and profiling tools

The Impact:
If you succeed, developers will love you. Fast builds = happy developers = productive team. This directly affects our entire engineering org (50+ developers).

Compensation: 20,000-25,000 NIS/month
Location: Ramat Gan, on-site (collaborative work with developers)

Looking for someone who enjoys solving complex build problems and isn't afraid of C++.

Timeline: Start interviews next week.
