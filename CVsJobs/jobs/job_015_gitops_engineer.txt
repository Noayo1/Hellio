Hey,

We're going all-in on GitOps and need someone who knows ArgoCD inside out. We're a cloud-native startup building developer tools.

- Build application deployment patterns (Helm, Kustomize)
- Set up progressive delivery (canary, blue-green via Argo Rollouts)
- Integrate ArgoCD with CI pipelines
- Implement secrets management in GitOps workflow
- Create self-service deployment for development teams
- Monitor and troubleshoot ArgoCD deployments

Your Experience:
- 3-4 years Kubernetes and CI/CD experience
- Strong ArgoCD knowledge (ApplicationSets, App of Apps pattern, sync waves)
- Helm and Kustomize expertise
- Git workflow design and best practices

Why Join Us:
- Cutting-edge GitOps implementation
