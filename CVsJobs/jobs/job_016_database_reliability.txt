Subject: Database Reliability Engineer - PostgreSQL Focus

Hi,

We're a data-intensive platform (B2B SaaS) and our databases are becoming a bottleneck. Looking for someone who understands both databases and reliability engineering.

The Problem:
We have 50TB+ of data in PostgreSQL, queries are slowing down, backups taking forever, and we're scared to do schema migrations. Need expert help.

What You'll Work On:
- PostgreSQL performance tuning and optimization
- Database reliability and high availability setup
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Schema migration automation (we deploy weekly)
- Query optimization and indexing strategies
- Monitoring and alerting for database health
- Capacity planning and scaling strategies
- Working with application teams on database design

Must Have:
- 5+ years database administration experience
- PostgreSQL expert level (configuration, replication, performance tuning)
- Experience with large-scale databases (multi-TB)
- Understanding of database internals (indexes, query planner, vacuum, etc.)
- Linux system administration
- Scripting and automation (Python, Bash)
- Experience with monitoring tools
- On-call experience

Specific PostgreSQL Skills:
- Replication setup (streaming, logical)
- Partitioning strategies
- Connection pooling (PgBouncer, PgPool)
- Extension management
- Backup tools (pg_dump, pgBackRest, WAL-G)
- Query analysis (EXPLAIN plans, pg_stat_statements)
- Upgrade procedures

Our Environment:
AWS RDS PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, self-managed PostgreSQL on EC2, pgBouncer, TimescaleDB, PostGIS, Python, Ansible, Terraform, Grafana, Prometheus

Additional Skills Needed:
- Data migration experience
- Understanding of CDC (Change Data Capture)
- Redis or similar caching layer
- Experience with analytical databases (ClickHouse, BigQuery)

This Role Is Critical:
Database is our core asset, downtime is not acceptable, and performance affects all customers. High responsibility, high impact.

Compensation: Top of market (database experts are rare)
24,000-30,000 NIS/month

Location: Hod Hasharon, hybrid after onboarding
On-call: Yes, but compensated separately

Timeline: URGENT - need to fill within 3 weeks

We need someone senior who has dealt with database scaling challenges.
