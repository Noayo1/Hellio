Subject: Staff Infrastructure Engineer - Leadership Role

Hi,

We're a unicorn startup (post Series D, 400 people, high growth) and need a Staff Infrastructure Engineer to lead our infrastructure strategy.

The Opportunity:
This is not a manager role - it's a technical leadership position. You'll be the most senior infrastructure person, setting direction and mentoring a team of 12 DevOps/SRE engineers.

What "Staff Engineer" Means Here:
- Define infrastructure strategy and roadmap
- Make build vs buy decisions
- Lead complex technical projects
- Mentor senior engineers
- Drive architectural discussions
- Work directly with CTO and VPs
- Represent infrastructure in company-wide planning
- Hands-on when needed, but mostly guiding others

Your Impact Areas:
- Scale infrastructure from 50M to 500M+ requests/day
- Cost optimization (we're spending $200K/month on cloud)
- Reliability improvements (current uptime 99.5%, need 99.9%)
- Developer experience and productivity
- Security and compliance as we approach IPO
- Team growth and hiring (we're doubling the team)

What We're Looking For:
- 10+ years infrastructure experience
- Led infrastructure at scale (high growth companies)
- Deep expertise in at least 2 areas: Kubernetes, cloud architecture, networking, databases, observability
- Strong technical leadership and mentorship ability
- Experience with infrastructure at startups that scaled
- System design and architecture skills
- Excellent communication with technical and non-technical audiences

Technical Requirements (You Don't Need All, But Most):
- Cloud platforms (we use AWS + GCP)
- Kubernetes at scale (1000+ nodes)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Distributed systems and microservices
- Cost optimization strategies
- Security best practices
- CI/CD and developer platforms
- Database scaling
- Observability and reliability

Our Stack:
AWS, GCP, EKS, GKE, Terraform, ArgoCD, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Datadog, PagerDuty

What Makes This Role Unique:
- Startup energy with scale-up resources
- Real technical leadership, not just management
- Huge impact on company trajectory
- Work with talented team
- Competitive compensation package

Compensation: Top 1% for Israeli market
35,000-50,000 NIS/month + significant equity (post Series D)

Benefits: Full package, unlimited vacation, learning budget, conferences, relocation assistance if needed

Location: Tel Aviv (hybrid, but need to be present for strategic meetings)

Hiring Process: Rigorous - 5-6 interviews including system design, technical deep dives, leadership assessment, CTO interview.

Timeline: 8-12 weeks hiring process. We're very selective.

This is a career-defining role if you're ready to step into technical leadership at a fast-growing company.
