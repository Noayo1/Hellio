Subject: Cloud Architect for Growing Startup

Hey,

We're a fast-growing SaaS startup (60 people, Series B) and need a cloud architect to own our entire infrastructure strategy.

The Situation:
We started on AWS but it's becoming expensive and messy. We need someone to:
- Redesign our cloud architecture for scale and cost efficiency
- Lead migration to multi-region setup (currently single region)
- Implement proper cost management (our AWS bill is out of control)
- Set up disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Mentor our 3-person DevOps team

Ideal Candidate:
- 7+ years cloud infrastructure experience
- AWS Solutions Architect certification (Professional level)
- Experience scaling systems from thousands to millions of users
- Strong FinOps mindset - we need to cut costs by 30-40%
- Infrastructure as Code expert (CDK or Pulumi preferred)
- Previous startup experience is a plus

Technical Requirements:
- AWS expertise (EC2, ECS/EKS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Lambda)
- Networking knowledge (VPC, VPN, Transit Gateway)
- Security best practices and compliance
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Experience with observability platforms

What We Offer:
- Equity (0.5-1%)
- Competitive salary
- Full ownership of infrastructure decisions
- Work directly with CTO
- Remote-friendly (but prefer someone in Israel)

Salary Range: 25,000-35,000 NIS/month depending on experience
Location: Remote or Tel Aviv office

We're interviewing on a rolling basis. Great opportunity to make huge impact!

Cheers,
Maya Cohen
CTO & Co-Founder, Startup Accelerator
