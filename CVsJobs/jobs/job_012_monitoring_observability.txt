Subject: Observability Engineer

Hi there,

We need an Observability Engineer to build our monitoring and observability stack from scratch. We're migrating from a monolith to microservices and our current monitoring isn't cutting it.

The Challenge:
We're transitioning to 50+ microservices and losing visibility. Debugging issues takes hours. We need someone to build a proper observability platform.

What You'll Build:
- Comprehensive logging infrastructure (ELK or similar)
- Metrics collection and visualization (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger or Tempo)
- Alerting that actually works (reducing noise, catching real issues)
- Dashboards for engineering and business teams
- SLI/SLO framework
- Cost monitoring and optimization

Your Background:
- 4-6 years DevOps/SRE experience
- Strong observability platform knowledge
- Experience with: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (or alternatives)
- Understanding of distributed tracing concepts
- Kubernetes monitoring experience
- PromQL and log query languages
- Experience with high-cardinality data

Technical Stack:
AWS, EKS, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Loki, Tempo, CloudWatch, Python

What You'll Do:
- Design and implement observability architecture
- Instrument applications with metrics and tracing
- Create meaningful dashboards and alerts
- Train developers on observability best practices
- Optimize costs (observability is getting expensive)
- Build runbooks and incident response procedures

Nice to Have:
- Experience with Datadog, New Relic, or Honeycomb
- Knowledge of eBPF-based tools
- OpenTelemetry implementation experience
- Previous platform/SRE team experience

Why This Role is Interesting:
- Green field project - build it right from the start
- High impact - improve reliability for entire engineering org
- Work with modern observability tools
- Shape the observability culture

Location: Raanana, hybrid (3 days office)
Salary: 19,000-24,000 NIS/month

We'd like to start interviews in 2 weeks.

Thanks,
Shira Kaplan
Head of SRE, Analytics Platform
