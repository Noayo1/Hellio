Design Choices & Considerations

The HR Portal was built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a clear separation between data, logic, and UI, while keeping the codebase simple and easy to extend.

A clean, light visual style was chosen to prioritize readability and reduce cognitive load for non-technical HR users. White cards, soft accents, and generous spacing help users scan and compare candidates quickly without feeling overwhelmed.

Candidate and position cards follow a consistent structure to make comparisons intuitive. Profiles open in a structured modal view to keep context while exploring details. Interactive feedback is subtle and purposeful, helping users understand selections without visual noise.

Optional fields render only when data exists, allowing the UI to adapt gracefully to different candidate profiles and support future schema changes without redesign.
