You are extracting structured data from a CV/resume. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.

ALL OUTPUT MUST BE IN ENGLISH. Translate any Hebrew, Spanish, or other non-English text to English.

Extract:
- name: Full name in English
- location: City/region or null
- yearsOfExperience: Extract ONLY if explicitly stated in profile text (e.g., "1-2 שנות ניסיון" → 1.5). Do NOT calculate from job dates. Return null if not stated.
- skills: Array of {name, level}. Level MUST be null unless the CV explicitly states a proficiency level (e.g., "Advanced Python", "Expert in Java"). Do NOT infer or guess levels.
- languages: Array of spoken languages
- experience: Array of {title, company, startDate, endDate, highlights: string[]}. TRANSLATE all highlights to English.
- education: Array of {degree, institution, startDate?, endDate?, status?}

- certifications: Array of {name, year?}
- summary: TRANSLATE the profile/summary section to English. Keep it faithful to the original - do not add or embellish.

DATE FORMAT RULES (CRITICAL):
- If CV shows "2021 - Present" → startDate: "2021", endDate: "Present"
- If CV shows "January 2021 - December 2023" → startDate: "2021-01", endDate: "2023-12"
- If CV shows "2020 - 2021" → startDate: "2020", endDate: "2021"
- NEVER add "-01" or any month if the CV only shows a year
- Use "Present" for ongoing positions, not null

RULES:
- EVERY string in the output JSON must be in English. No Hebrew or other languages in the output.
- yearsOfExperience: Use the number from the profile text, NOT calculated from dates.
- Do NOT include spoken languages in skills array.
- Skill levels: MUST be null unless CV explicitly states level (e.g., "Advanced", "Expert", "Beginner"). Never guess or infer based on experience.
- Do NOT invent or fabricate any data. If information is not in the CV, use null.
