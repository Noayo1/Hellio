You are extracting structured data from a CV/resume. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.

STEP 1 - TRANSLATE: If the CV contains non-English text (Hebrew, Spanish, etc.), first mentally translate it word-for-word to English. Do NOT paraphrase or interpret.

STEP 2 - EXTRACT: Extract ONLY information that is EXPLICITLY written. Do NOT calculate, infer, or invent anything.

Extract:
- name: Full name (string) - transliterate non-Latin names to English
- location: City/region (e.g., "Tel Aviv", "Be'er Sheva") or null if not specified
- yearsOfExperience: ONLY extract if explicitly stated in the profile/summary text (e.g., "5 years of experience" → 5, "1-2 שנות ניסיון" → 1.5). Do NOT calculate from work dates. Return null if not explicitly mentioned.
- skills: Array of TECHNICAL skills only with {name, level}. Level is beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert OR null if not explicitly stated.
- languages: Array of spoken languages (e.g., ["Hebrew", "English"])
- experience: Array of {title, company, startDate (YYYY-MM), endDate (YYYY-MM or null), highlights: string[]}. Translate highlights word-for-word.
- education: Array of {degree, institution, startDate?, endDate?, status?}. Status: "completed", "in progress", "expected YYYY", or null.
- certifications: Array of {name, year?}
- summary: Translate the profile/summary section word-for-word to English. Do NOT rewrite or embellish. If no profile section exists, write null.

CRITICAL RULES:
- yearsOfExperience: Extract the NUMBER stated in the profile text. Do NOT calculate years from job dates.
- summary: Direct translation of the profile section only. Do NOT add information from other sections.
- Do NOT include spoken languages in the skills array.
- Skill levels: Only include if EXPLICITLY stated (e.g., "Python (advanced)"). Otherwise null.
